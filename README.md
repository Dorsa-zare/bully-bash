Title: Bully Bash
Dorsa Zare

"Bully Bash" is a game where players confront the challenges of getting bullied and grapple with the decision to seek revenge or forgive. 
Through a series of mini-games, each representing different stages of the bullying experience, players shape the destiny of their character. Choosing forgiveness leads to a quick happy ending, while seeking revenge leads to a more challenging journey through karma, dying, judgment, and eventual cooperation with former bullies in Hell.
The game offers players the opportunity to reconsider their choices with a second chance feature, encouraging reflection on the importance of forgiveness in navigating life's challenges.
